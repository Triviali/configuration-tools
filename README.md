# Triviali's Configuration Tools

This project is designed to improve productivity for computer technicians working on laptop systems with a WMS system that thoroughly records specifications.

Note to users: the sidebar in the dashboard is deprecated. The program might be reworked to interface with the current WMS based on demand. Looking into python automation and IO between other browser windows.

# Setup and Usage
Make sure the latest version of Python 3 is installed & added to your PATH, then run Dependencies.bat to install the required libraries.

Run dashboard.bat to open the configuration dashboard. This program provides a search box to locate configurations found in the Excel spreadsheet

# Administration

Running NewConfigurationForm.bat opens a simple GUI that allows you to add configurations to the Excel database.

The Excel database can be manually edited. Just make sure the dashboard and NewConfigurationForm are closed.
